      <Paragraph>
        We reserve the right to update or modify these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice. Your use of Ashclair Web site following
        any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the terms and conditions as changed. For this reason, we encourage you to

      <Paragraph>
        Pricing errors may occur on the Ashclair Site from time to time. Ashclair attempts to correct all pricing errors as soon as they are
        discovered, or as soon as Ashclair receives notice of an error. Ashclair reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors,
        with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation. Any payments you make to Ashclair for orders that are
        cancelled due to pricing errors will be refunded.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The goods will be imported on behalf of the consignee/buyer. The consignee authorizes Ashclair to import the goods on his behalf. Further, the
        consignee/buyer agrees Ashclair may delegate the obligation to import the goods on his behalf to a subcontractor (e.g. customs broker). The
        consignee will pay the taxes & duties in addition with the purchase price of the goods.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={4}>Custom Orders</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        Customized and Custom Made items cannot be returned. These are orders by which the customer had modified including Upgraded Stones,
        Modifications and New Designs.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title level={4}>Layaway</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        Try our convenient layaway plan! We have an interest-free layaway plan that runs from 3-24 month from the initial date of deposit. Simply make
        a deposit on your item and we will keep your jewelry aside for you until it is paid in full. Once you have paid for your purchase in full, we
        will ship your item directly to you. The advantage of our jewelry layaway program is that if the price of a jewelry item increases over time,
        your price will still remain unchanged. It will be locked in at your original purchase price. This also affords you the flexibility of paying
        for your jewelry over time.
      </Paragraph>
